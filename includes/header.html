      I've always been a keen writer. English was my best subject in school bringing in my best grades, small projects featured in books, and a couple of articles for motorcycle publications. Now is the time to turn writing literature into writing code!

        A few weeks before my 17th birthday my mate turned up at my house astride a silver CG125. Admittedly not the sexiest bike in the world but enough to stir up a feeling that made me ditch my driving lessons and crack on with my CBT. 8 years later...

        Back to school and I'd be on a bike all the time. To and from school, out with mates, messing about in the woods. As I grew older and my next 2 wheeled toy had an engine, I left it bicycling behind... until now.

        How can you grow up with the Fast & Furious franchise and not be into cars? I don't know, because it had me hooked! My love for cars stretches deeper than loud exhausts and loud paint (although you wouldn't tell from the pic) and these days I just try to work out what would be a better motor for my skyline, a gallo 12 or a gallo 24?
